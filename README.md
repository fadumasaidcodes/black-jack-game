* The player can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand).
* The player wins if their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over.
* The game ends when the player chooses to "stand" or their hand value goes over 21.

* Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.
* Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points.
* All other cards are worth their face value.
